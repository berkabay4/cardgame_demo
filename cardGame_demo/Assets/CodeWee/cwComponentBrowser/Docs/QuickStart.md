# CodeWee Component Browser

## Summary

"Simplify your Unity Editor experience with a powerful List View of all Scene Components."

**Component Browser** is a powerful Unity Editor tool that lists all Components of GameObjects in loaded Scenes as a sortable, searchable List View — enabling fast, easy navigation and filtering beyond the standard Hierarchy panel.

## Description

- **Component Browser** revolutionizes how you explore and manage GameObjects and Components in your Unity project. Unlike the traditional Hierarchy view, this Editor extension displays all Components across loaded Scenes in a clean, flat List View, helping you quickly locate and manage elements without diving through nested structures.

- With intuitive features like **sortable** columns, component type **filters**, and direct selection highlighting in the Hierarchy, you can focus on building your game rather than searching for objects. Whether you're managing large-scale scenes or debugging complex setups, Component Browser provides a **faster**, **smarter** way to work inside Unity.

- Supports **Unity 2022** and **Unity 6000+ (Unity 6.x)**.
